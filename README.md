# 🧪 trybox

**trybox** is a local-first utility for Python developers to write, save, and safely execute code snippets in isolated subprocesses. It offers a clean interface to tag and timestamp experiments, making it easy to organize, revisit, and rerun them at any time. Built entirely on the Python standard library, trybox runs fully offline, without telemetry or cloud dependencies, and is ideal for quick prototyping, testing ideas, or maintaining a persistent scratchpad.

## Features

- Save Python snippets with descriptions and timestamps  
- Run snippets in isolated subprocess environments

- Fully offline, no telemetry, no third-party dependencies
